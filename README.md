Hawaii Power Ballot
===================

Hawaii Power Ballot is a project to provide a version of a ballot where you can click on the candidate to get more information about that candidate.

Details
-------
Get started by viewing the [interactive map](http://civic-celerator.maps.arcgis.com/apps/OnePane/basicviewer/index.html?appid=eabd4dbf3fcb48468cd92587b2d8729c). In the map you click on your house (you can input your address in the "find address" search box in the upper right). Then if you address already has a power ballot you will see power ballot as one of the options in the pop-up (currently only the districts 18-01, 18-02, 18-03, 18-04 exist, which is why we need volunteers!).

Example power ballot pages:
